# app_ohmyfuel

### **Description**

OhMyFuel is a Flutter-based mobile application that allow users to input travel distance, car fuel efficiency inside textfields, and choose fuel type(RON95, RON97 and Diesel) from a dropdown button. The app will perform the calculation for the user and display the fuel needed to cover the travel distance based on the car fuel efficiency and also the fuel cost based on fuel needed and fuel price.

## Inputs -> Process -> Output

- **Inputs:**
  - distance(km), car fuel efficiency(km/litre), fuel type
- **Process**
  - formula used:
    - fuel needed = distance/ efficiency, efficiency>0
    - cost = fuel needed \* selected fuel price
- **Output**
  - user will see 3 things inside the output container:
    - selected fuel and its price(RM/litre)
    - fuel needed
    - cost

## Basic Validation Approach

- ensures only numeric values(0-9) are entered and cannot exceed a fixed length of digits using 'FilteringTextInputFormatter' with regex (r'^\d{1,5}\.?\d{0,3}')
- Check for missing values in textfields
- displays error text message 'Required Field' using **Visibility** and **Text**, with _visibility_ set to true
- check for 0 value for fuel efficiency
- prevents division by zero
- displays error text message 'Efficiency Cannot be Zero' using **Visibility** and **Text**, with _visibility_ set to true
